I try to make a MVC website with C# .net Framework

# About site

This site is a personel diary.You write your day ,and somebody read it then they will comment,dont like or dont share.Normal social media system is not working here.We do this because,normal social media working with our ego (Like,share and follower etc.),if you dont have a more follower than your following people,you will feel bad or feel deficient.We will try to change this,all people need to share their thoughts.
